# android-memory-hog

Android Memory Hog tries to allocate large bunchs of memory.

The original motivaion is to pressure other apps to trim their memory and close activities, making possible to check if they are properly handling this scenario.

*THIS APP IS POTTENTIALLY DANGEROUS.*

By *POTTENTIALLY DANGEROUS* I mean: i know no direct harm, but it can force apps to a state they can do harm.
